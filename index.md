## Inspiration
I have always wanted to try building apps with React, as well as experimenting with Firebase and Google Cloud. I was able to incorporate all of those things into one project with PicUp.

## What it does
Securely upload images to Google Cloud.

## How I built it
React for the frontend app UI and Firebase as the backend and cloud integration.

## Challenges I ran into
I had never touched any of the tools or languages I used for this project. There were many useful resources out on the Internet, but the tools have been changing rapidly thanks to their popularity, which unfortunately leads to a lot of legacy examples that don't work with the latest releases. With only very basic Web Dev experience, I experienced a very steep learning curve to get started.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I was able to produce a functional demo of the React + Firebase during a limited time span while working all by myself.

## What I learned
React, Firebase, Google Cloud APIs

## What's next for PicUp
I was hoping to incorporate Google Cloud Vision API to analyze and catalog images that were uploaded.
